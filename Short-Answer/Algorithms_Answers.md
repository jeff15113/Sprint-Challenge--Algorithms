Add your answers to the Algorithms exercises here.

I.
    a) O(n) - This is a linear function. As n increases the time it take increases linearly.

    b) O(n^4) - This is a quadratic function. As n increases time increases exponentially

    C) O(n) - This is a linear function. As n increaces the number of times the function gets called also increases

II.
    I would implement this the same way i would implement an algorithm to find a random number. 

    Split the number set in half creating 2 lists of floors, so n/2. try dropping the egg on the last  floor on the first list if it breaks then toss out the first list, there no good. Now split the remaining list again, into two lists. Dropping the egg on the last floor on the first list. If it doesnt break then toss the second list as it has no use to us because we know the egg wont break on any of them. this will keep repeating until we have 1 floor left.
